# Payments Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete payments feature has been added to the Laravel/Vue application with a one-to-many relationship from invoices to payments.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Database Migration
**File**: `database/migrations/2025_10_11_054721_create_payments_table.php`

Creates the `payments` table with the following columns:
- `id` - Primary key
- `invoice_id` - Foreign key to invoices table (cascade on delete)
- `amount` - Decimal(10,2) for payment amount
- `payment_method` - String (credit_card, debit_card, paypal, bank_transfer, cash, check)
- `transaction_id` - Nullable string for transaction reference
- `status` - String with default 'pending' (pending, completed, failed, refunded)
- `notes` - Nullable text field
- `paid_at` - Nullable timestamp for payment completion date
- `created_at` & `updated_at` - Timestamps

### 2. Payment Model
**File**: `app/Models/Payment.php`

Features:
- Belongs to Invoice relationship
- Fillable fields for mass assignment
- Type casting for amount (decimal) and paid_at (datetime)
- Factory support for seeding

### 3. Invoice Model Update
**File**: `app/Models/Invoice.php`

Added:
- `payments()` relationship method (hasMany)

### 4. Payment Factory
**File**: `database/factories/PaymentFactory.php`

Features:
- Generates realistic payment data
- Random payment methods and statuses
- State methods: `completed()`, `pending()`, `failed()`
- Automatic transaction IDs using UUIDs

### 5. Payment Seeder
**File**: `database/seeders/PaymentSeeder.php`

Features:
- Creates 1-5 random payments for each existing invoice
- Uses the Payment factory
- Validates that invoices exist before seeding

**Updated**: `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` to call PaymentSeeder

### 6. Invoice Payments Controller
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/InvoicePaymentsController.php`

Features:
- Extends BaseOrionController for Orion API integration
- Searchable by: id, transaction_id, payment_method, status
- Filterable by: id, amount, payment_method, status, transaction_id, paid_at
- Sortable by: id, amount, payment_method, status, paid_at, created_at, updated_at
- Can include 'invoice' relation
- Full authorization for authenticated users
- CRUD operations through Orion API

### 7. API Routes
**File**: `routes/api.php`

Added:
```php
Orion::hasManyResource('invoices', 'payments', InvoicePaymentsController::class);
```

This creates the following endpoints:
- `GET /api/invoices/{invoice}/payments` - List all payments for an invoice
- `POST /api/invoices/{invoice}/payments` - Create a payment for an invoice
- `GET /api/invoices/{invoice}/payments/{payment}` - Get a specific payment
- `PUT/PATCH /api/invoices/{invoice}/payments/{payment}` - Update a payment
- `DELETE /api/invoices/{invoice}/payments/{payment}` - Delete a payment

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Payment TypeScript Model
**File**: `resources/js/models/Payment.ts`

Defines the Payment model with TypeScript interface:
- All payment fields with proper types
- Extends Laravel Orion Model class
- Resource endpoint configuration

### 2. InvoicesExample.vue Updates
**File**: `resources/js/pages/InvoicesExample.vue`

Added:
1. **Import**: Payment model
2. **State management**:
   - `invoicePayments` - Stores payments by invoice ID
   - `loadingPayments` - Loading state for payments

3. **Helper functions**:
   - `loadPayments(invoiceId)` - Fetches payments for an invoice
   - `getTotalPayments(invoiceId)` - Calculates total payment amount
   - `formatDateTime()` - Formats payment date/time
   - `getStatusSeverity()` - Returns PrimeVue severity based on payment status
   - `getPaymentMethodIcon()` - Returns appropriate icon for payment method

4. **UI Updates**:
   - New "Payments" tab in the expanded row view
   - Comprehensive payment data table showing:
     - Payment ID (as tag)
     - Amount (formatted currency)
     - Payment method (with icons)
     - Status (colored tags)
     - Transaction ID
     - Payment date/time
     - Notes
   - Total payments summary card
   - Loading spinner during data fetch
   - Empty state message when no payments exist
   - Click handler on tab to load payments on demand

## Database Setup Instructions

1. **Run migrations** (if not already applied):
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

2. **Seed the database** (this will create payments for existing invoices):
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=PaymentSeeder
```

Or seed everything:
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

3. **Fresh database** (if you want to start fresh):
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## Usage

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the Invoices page
2. Click on the expand icon (‚ñ∫) for any invoice
3. Click on the "Payments" tab
4. View all payments associated with that invoice
5. See payment details including amount, method, status, and more
6. View total payments at the bottom of the table

### API
Using the Laravel Orion client or direct HTTP requests:

```javascript
// Get all payments for an invoice
const payments = await Payment.$query().get(invoiceId);

// Create a new payment
const newPayment = await Payment.$query().store(invoiceId, {
    amount: 100.00,
    payment_method: 'credit_card',
    status: 'completed',
    transaction_id: 'TXN123456',
    paid_at: new Date().toISOString(),
});

// Update a payment
payment.$attributes.status = 'completed';
await payment.$save();

// Delete a payment
await payment.$destroy();
```
